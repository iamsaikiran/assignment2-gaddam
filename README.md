Finding Power of Factorial Divisor from **Combinatorics**

> The full scope of combinatorics is not universally agreed upon.[1] According to H.J. Ryser, a definition of the subject is difficult because it crosses so many mathematical subdivisions.[2] Insofar as an area can be described by the types of problems it addresses, combinatorics is involved with:

> the enumeration (counting) of specified structures, sometimes referred to as arrangements or configurations in a very general sense, associated with finite systems,
> the existence of such structures that satisfy certain given criteria,
> the construction of these structures, perhaps in many ways, and
> optimization: finding the "best" structure or solution among several possibilities, be it the "largest", "smallest" or satisfying some other optimality criterion.
